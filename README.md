# Bond Default Risk Scoring Model (债券违约风险评分模型)

### Project Description (项目描述)

This repository contains the code for replicating a bond default risk scoring model, which I developed during my previous internship. The goal of this model is to evaluate the default risk of bonds based on four key factors:

- Fundamental Analysis: Analyzing companies' financial health through financial statement analysis.
- News Announcements: Conducting sentiment analysis on company announcements and relevant news articles.
- Primary Market Information: Using data from bond issuance events to gauge the risk.
- Secondary Market Prices: Analyzing bond price movements in the secondary market.

The model uses a logistic regression approach to calculate a default risk score for each bond. The final score is smoothed to ensure consistency over time.

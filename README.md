# Bond-Default-Model
Using Log-reg model, I integrated the annual report, face value, annual yield, news(NLP) of issuers to predict the risk of default rate of corporate bonds that update everyday. History performance are also considered and smoothed so the score of risk won't fluctuate too much. Is you are interested in this project, DM me so I can give you a glimpse.
